# Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge

Re-learning Basic CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-css) as a continuation of the previous day's course about HTML (HyperText Markup Language).

On this 3rd day, I haven't code anything new, but I did learn a few things about CSS. :smile:
