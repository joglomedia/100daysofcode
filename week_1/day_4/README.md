# Day 4 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge

Finishing free course of Basic CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-css) as a continuation of the previous day's learning.

Some key points I got from this course:

✔️ PX, EM, and REM
✔️ Hex color code and RGB
✔️ Variables property and var() function
